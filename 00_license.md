- mobile / portable station and the general station **cannot be operated simultaneously**
- the call-sign = general station followed by `/M` or `/P`
- transmitter output power of the portable station shall not exceed `10 watts (erp)`

- it is readily movable from place to place to be operated therefrom
- station fee of $50.00 per mobile/portable station is **waived**
- station shall be closed down at any time on the demand of an authorised officer acting under the authority of IMDA

### Frequency checking equipment in amateur stations

- A licensee must:
	- be able to verify that his transmissions are within the authorised frequency band
	- no appreciable energy is radiated outside the band
	- use a satisfactory method of frequency control
	- transmissions do not contain unwanted frequencies
	- transmission do not contain harmonics and spurious frequencies
- station requires a **crystal reference source**
	- with a transmitter (crystal-controlled)
		- an absorption device of *suitable frequency range and accuracy* is necessary
		- check that the desired harmonic of the crystal frequency is selected
	- with a transmitter (not crystal-controlled)
	 	- a wavemeter based on a crystal oscillator is necessary
- Frequency measuring equipment
	- should be of sufficient accuracy
		- an accuracy of `±1.0%`: operation in the centre of the `21.0 MHz - 21.45 MHz` band
		- an accuracy of `±0.05%`: `10 kHz` of band-edge
	- verify that emissions are within the authorised frequency bands
- Heterodyne wavemeters and crystal calibrators
	- frequencies up to `4 MHz`: `100 kHz` crystal is usually adequate
	- higher frequencies: `500 kHz` crystal or preferably `1 MHz`
- Absorption wavemeters and similar devices
	- scale length and accuracy should be suitable for measurements of the required accuracy to be made
	- the **frequency coverage** must extend up to the **second and preferably the third harmonic** of the radiated frequency
	- For VHF and UHF transmitters
		- best technique is to measure the frequency of the fundamental oscillator as accurately as possible
		- use an absorption device to confirm that the wanted harmonic has been selected
	- VHF or UHF converter
		- the calibration of the main receiver can be checked with sufficient accuracy
		- also advisable to use an absorption wavemeter to check the measurement and to confirm that no unwanted radiations are present

### Modulation symbols

The ITU uses an internationally agreed system for classifying radio frequency signals. Each type of radio emission is classified according to its **bandwidth, method of modulation, nature of the modulating signal, and type of information transmitted** on the carrier signal. It is based on characteristics of the signal, not on the transmitter used.

| Symbol | Modulation | Carrier | Sideband | Example
| --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
| A | amplitude | | Double | AM broadcast radio
| R | |	reduced or variable | Single
| G |	phase
